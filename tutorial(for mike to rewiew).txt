Good morning, Mr Claus! We are happy to have you working with us!
As this is your first day on the job, here are some guidelines -

Children all around the world have been both naughty and nice,
and it's your job to judge them!
Each child has their own file [click on the child to open it],
this file will contain:
-general information about the child
-good and bad actions the child has done in the past year [click on the action to get details]
-the child's letter to you [click letter to open]

After examining a child's file, click [Judge],
then drag the child to the right if you consider them [Nice],
or drag the child to the left if you consider them [Naughty].

PS: Error in judgement will result in immediate termination of your contract.
